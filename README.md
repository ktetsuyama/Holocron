## Introduction

AS A Star Wars fan,
I WANT to know which movie I should watch next depending on the character I like, from one of the Star Wars movies,
SO THAT I can watch a new movie that might be as good as Star Wars.

## Problem

GIVEN THAT I have an interest in watching more films that feature my favorite Star Wars characters:

WHEN I choose a movie from the series,

THEN I get the option to choose a lightside character or a darkside character from that movie;

WHEN I choose a lightside character or a darkside character,

THEN I get a a list of trivia about that character;

WHEN I choose a lightside character or a darkside character,

THEN I get a recommendation for another film with that lightside character or darkside character that I can go watch.

## Solution

We created an application that allows the user to choose a film from the Star Wars franchise (Episode 1-6) and is then show a picture of that character, a list of that characters vital stats, and a list of other films that have that character's name in the title. We used two APIs to get the information that we wish to display: [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/).
